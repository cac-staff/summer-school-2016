  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  The Compute Ontario Summer School on High Performance and Technical Computing
  is an annual educational event for graduate/undergraduate students, postdocs
  and researchers who are engaged in a compute intensive research. Held geographically
  in the west, centre and east of the province of Ontario, the summer school provides attendees
  with the opportunity to learn and share knowledge and experience in high performance
  and technical computing on modern HPC platforms.
</p>
<p>
  This is the website for Compute Ontario Summer School East (University of Ottawa), hosted by
  the Centre for Advanced Computing. This year's workshop is divided into two different streams 
  focusing on topics in either general programming/data analysis or parallel programming/high performance computing.
</p>

<p id="Stream 2">
  <strong>Stream 1</strong> of this year's workshop is focused on data analysis and general purpose programming.
  Students will learn how to use the command-line, write programs in R and Python, handle data using SQL,
  use Git for version control, and receive a primer on visualization. No prior computing experience is needed for
  this stream and is appropriate for anyone wanting to learn more about programming and high performance computing.
</p>

<p id="Stream 2">
  <strong>Stream 2</strong> of this year's summer school covers advanced topics in high performance computing, with a focus 
  on parallel programming. The topics of this stream include shared memory programming with OpenMP, parallel programming
  with the Posix Thread Library, distributed memory programming with MPI, and programming GPUs with CUDA. Although no prior 
  experience with parallel programming is required, basic skills with C, C++, or Fortran is expected.

  ETHERPAD

  At `_misc/etherpad.txt` you will find a template for the etherpad.

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
  e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
